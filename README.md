#  Realm Getting Started: macOS SwiftUI

This project is a macOS version of the SwiftUI project presented in the Realm Getting Started Guide; SwiftUI Quick Start

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/device-sdks/sdk/swift/swiftui-tutorial/#complete-code

It demonstrates how to use Realm Local Only and also how to use Flexible Sync to sync to the Atlas back end server.

To use, you'll need to set up an install Realm SDK per the Getting Started Guide

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/device-sdks/sdk/swift/install/

as well as following the instructions to add Sync

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/device-sdks/sdk/swift/sync/

Once done, get the AppID from the MongoDB Console website and add it to the Realm_SwiftUI_macOSApp file

let kAppId = "add_your_appId_here"

This is still a work in progress and the code is documented.
